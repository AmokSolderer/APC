# Installation frames

The APC board is a lot smaller than the boards it replaces. That means you cannot use the fixtures of the original boards to attach the APC to, which makes affixing an APC board in your backbox a bit cumbersome.

The installation frames on this page offer a solution to overcome this problem. Depending on the game generation they consist of two or three parts to build a frame and four legs. The legs are mounted below the attachment holes of the APC. They have a double purpose as they are mainly hollow but the hole has a cross like shape and can therefore be used as a thread for a 2mm woodscrew.

## System 3 - 7

The left side of the System 7 frame is split into two parts to be also suited for smaller printers.
