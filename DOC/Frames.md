# Installation frames

The APC board is a lot smaller than the boards it replaces. That means you cannot use the fixtures of the original boards to attach the APC to, which makes affixing an APC board in your backbox a bit cumbersome.

The installation frames on this page offer a solution to overcome this problem. Depending on the game generation they consist of two to four parts to build a frame and four legs. The legs are mounted below the attachment holes of the APC. They have a double purpose as they are mainly hollow but the hole has a cross like shape and can therefore be used as a thread for a 2mm woodscrew.

## System 3 - 7

The left side of the System 7 frame is split into two parts to be also suited for smaller printers.  
The lower rail which holds the original CPU board must be removed for this to fit.

## System 9

Note that the two parts of the System 9 frame are not identical as the APC board must be shifted a bit to the right to avoid a metal mounting post of the backbox.

## System 11 without interconnect board

This frame is for the early System11 games without an interconnect board. It consists of four parts as the right side is split into two parts to be also suited for smaller printers.

## System 11 with interconnect board

This frame is for the later System11 games with an interconnect board. It consists of four parts as the lower side is split into two parts to be also suited for smaller printers.
