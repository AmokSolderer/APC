# What is the Arduino Pinball Controller?
The APC is a replacement controller for Williams pinball machines.
It has been tested with System 7 and System 11 machines, but it should work with System 6 and System 9 also. It contains the required circuitry to drive lamps, switches and solenoids as well as an audio amplifier with two channels and an SD card connector. Hence the APC can replace all CPU, power driver and sound related boards. However, you still need the power supply board and the interconnect boards used by several System 11 games.
