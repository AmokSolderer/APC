# The Arduino Pinball Controller
![APC 2.0](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/blob/master/DOC/PICS/APC.JPG)
## Overview

The APC is a freely programmable controller for Williams pinball machines. It uses an Arduino Due and contains all the circuitry required to run a Williams pinball machine from System 3 to System 11c (and the compatible Data East machines):

* Display interface for all corresponding display types
* 24 Solenoid drivers
* Lamp matrix drivers for 64 lamps
* Switch matrix drivers for 64 switches + 8 non matrix switches
* SD card interface (to store audio files, highscores and settings)
* Audio amplifier with two channels (to play music and sound effects simultaneously / can be changed to single channel stereo)
* Hardware extensions interface (the pinout is compatible to the Sound Overlay Solenoid Board used in games like Whirlwind, but it is upgraded a bit to support all kind of self made hardware)

To summarize the above it can be said that the APC does replace all CPU, power driver and sound related boards, at a price of well below 100â‚¬ per board. A more detailed calculation of the costs can be found in the [APC wiki](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/wiki/Home).

However, at the moment the APC cannot run the original Williams EPROM software. For this, someone has to write an interface to PinMame and this someone is definitely not me. Instead this board is meant to be a platform for people who want to program their own rules and features. Therefore the APC software offers an API providing the necessary commands to make this a lot easier, but you still have to code the game specific part by yourself.

To see the APC in action take a look at my [Black Knight game video](https://youtu.be/N5ipyHBKzgs)

The following picture shows the APC 2.0 in a Black Knight with the LED Expansion board connected to the hardware extensions interface.

A short video with this setup can be found here :

The LED expansion board is a self made board to control WS2812 based LED-Strips with the APC. In this case it's used just as an example. For more information about this board please refer to the [hardware section](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/tree/master/DOC/Hardware).

Basically the hardware extensions interface is an 8 bit bus with several enable signals which can be used for all kinds of additional hardware.

## Current Status (March 2019)

### Hardware

The APC hardware status is mature. I have version 2.0 in use for more than a year now without anything to complain about. Beginning of march 2019 I built a version 2.1 board which spared some components and had some slight layout changes. The version in the [hardware section](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/tree/master/DOC/Hardware) is 2.2 which has just one capacitor changed to SMD and the corresponding line removed.

I have tested the APC in a Black Knight (System 7), a Pinbot (System 11a) and a Rollergames (System 11c), but I checked the connector pinouts and it should work with System 3,4,6 and 9 as well as the compatible Data East machines also.

In the Pinbot I had to cut some cable ties and open up the wiring harness a bit in order to make the cable connectors reach their corresponding counterparts on the board. This is necessary as the APC is much smaller than the original circuit boards and the location of the connectors differs from System to System.

Later System11 machines with an auxiliary power and interconnect board need 3 cable extensions, see the preparation section in [the wiki](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/wiki) for details.

### Software

The software consists of two parts: the operating system APC.ino and the game specific code. The former controls the hardware and offers an application interface (API) for the game specific software to use. For an overview of the available API variables and commands please take a look at the
[APC software reference](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/blob/master/DOC/Software/APC_SW_reference.pdf).

I have written game codes for my Black Knight and Pinbot. They are still not final, but good enough to have fun with and to use as a reference when writing own code. Additionally there's a Base Code which should serve as a starting point for you to do your own game. It contains the very basics of a pinball game and it can be easily adapted to your machine. As a startup guide how to start writing game code I have written a short tutorial in the [wiki](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/wiki) section.

Please note that I have equipped my Black Knight with a [special kind of display](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/tree/master/DOC/Hardware/Sys7Alpha) and the APC currently does not support the original displays. This is not because it would be difficult to make them work (it is actually quite easy), but how to implement a menu system when your display can only show numbers? Additionally it would be quite cumbersome to debug some game software without the display being able to show letters. Therfore I recommend to use an early System11 display which has at least one row with alphanumeric displays (or build my System7Alpha).

### To Do

I have just put the APC in a Rollergames. This required three cables to be extended a bit, since the auxiliary boards of this System11c machine makes the wiring quite inflexible and these three cable are just too short (see the Preparation section in the Wiki for details). For the hardware this is no big deal, but the display will require some adaption in the software. To make this work I just started a Base Code which provides basic pinball funtionality and should work in all machines with only small adaptions.

However apart from writing new game code and generating sound samples the following software improvements come to my mind:

* Add a mode for the APC being controlled by a PC via USB. This would enable PinMame or the Mission Pinball Framework to use the APC. With PinMame, the APC could also be used as a replacement for old boards and the MPF could ease the design of homebrew games. (coming next)
* Implementation of a better error handler
* Think about how to implement the early displays, as the _numbers only_ displays of the System3 to 7 machines are not supported at the moment - mainly because I don't like them (I want a highscore list). I'm just not sure how to handle menus and so on - may be use the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE to show them on a PC or add a bluetooth module to the APC and do the settings with an APP on your smartphone...

## Why this page?

Basically this is a private fun project for me and some friends and it was never meant to go public. However, after a while I realized that the APC offers much more potential than I could handle as some kind of 'one man army'. I've done the necessary basics, which is the hardware and the software to run it, but I don't think I'm the right guy to invent new rules or add the right amount of polish to the game software that makes for a great game. And I'm definitely not the right guy to dig into the PinMame code and write some kind of driver to make it control the APC which could then be used as a general cheap and simple replacement board (which would be quite cool though). Therefore I hope to establish a small community of people who can do that and just need a base to start from.
 
## Feedback

Feedback is very important for me, because if there is none I must assume that nobody is interested in this project and that I can stop to bother with additional documentation or selecting a board manufacturer. And albeit I have tried my best to help you to become familiar with this project, there will be questions and I am willing to do some support. Like I said, it's a hobby so don't expect 24/7 availability, but I'll do my best to help.

**So if you're interested please leave some feedback in the [Flippertreff forum (german)](https://www.flippertreff.de/start/forum/topic/11356-arduino-pinball-controller/) or in the  - [Pinside Form (english)](https://pinside.com/pinball/forum/topic/arduino-pinball-controller#post-4898318).**

## How to get a board?

I'm sorry, but I'm not going to sell them. However, I have tried to put the required information for building a board and using the software to the [APC wiki](https://github.com/AmokSolderer/APC/wiki/Home)
